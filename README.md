# Hotel_Reservation_Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_Visualization
The main aim of this project is to reduce customer reservation cancellation. We understood that the 2 hotels used in this project, for the period covered, expereinced a high rate of hotel booking cancellations. So we set out to help these hotels analyze customer behavior, which in turn, would enable them offer suitable incentives or exploit areas of strenght to reduce customer booking cancellation rate and generate more revenue.

Some of the challenges causing high booking cancellation rate identified includes; high daily booking rate, prolonged lead time leads to cancellation.
